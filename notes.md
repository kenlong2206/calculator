## Directory Structure
- all code in `src` directory
- all tests in `tests` directory. Unit tests in `unit`. Other directories to be created as more testing is added 
- all test results in `tests/test_reports`
- list of packages to be installed in `requirements.txt`
- ignore `venv` (virtual environment) and `.pytest_cache` files (autogenerated and should not be in git)
 
## GIT Setup
- `/.gitignore` file to tell git to ignore certain file types and not add them to git
- gitflow branching model

## Code
- all calculator code in `src/main.py`. a single class with 2 endpoints (`/` and `/calculate`)
- class setup to allow 2 floats and a string (operation) to be passed to the `calculate` end point
- built using `fastAPI` framework with `pedantic` for data validation
- use `uvicorn` as an ASGI server (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) to serve the application. It handles asynchronous I/O, HTTP/2 websocket support
- to run from command line: `uvicorn src.main:app --reload` (reload will automatically restart server when changes are made)
- openAPI visible on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- to run curl from command line:
  - ```curl -Method POST -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/calculate -Headers @{'accept'='application/json'; 'Content-Type'='application/json'} -Body '{"num1": 5, "num2": 12, "operation": "multiply"}'```

## Unit Testing
- unit test files start with `test_<name of module being tested>` (pytest will search for these files)
- unit tests for `main.py` in '/tests/unit/test_main.py'
- unit tests use pytest (need pip install pytest)
- coverage report uses `pytest-cov` (need pip install pytest-cov)
- each test posts a json string to the endpoint, and uses assert statements to check a valid response (status code 200) is received, and the result returned is correct)
- pytest config stored in `.pytest.ini`
  - the following options are set: ```- --cov=src --cov-report=xml:tests/test_reports/coverage.xml --cov-report=html:tests/test_reports/htmlcov --junitxml=tests/test_reports/xunit-result.xml```. This runs the coverage addin and stores results in `tests/test_reports` 
- tests can be run from the command line from project root directory (`...Pycharm Projects/calculator`): ` python -m pytest` 
- a run configuration can also be setup to run from within pycharm

## CI Pipeline
- github workflow automation files in `.github/workflows`
- ci workflow in `ci.yml`

## SonarCloud
- sonar properties stored in project root `sonar-project.properties`
- login at `https://sonarcloud.io/` (select login via Github)
- on top menu bar click `Account -> My Organisations`. Click to create an account if needed
- on top menu bar click `+` -> `Analyse New Project`. it should list all the github projects. select the one to be analysed
  - click `My Projects` and click the project
  - on left nav under `Information` copy the `Project Key` and `Organisation Key` and paste them into the ci.yml file in the approprate sonar properties
- paste them into `sonar-project.properties`:
  ```  
    sonar.projectKey=<project key>
    sonar.organization=<organisation key>
  ```
- setup a secure connection between sonar and github 
  - on top menu bar click `Account -> My Organisations`
    - select `Security` tab
      - enter a token name e.g. calculator and click `generate`
    - copy the resulting secret
    - goto `github`, select the 'calculator' project and click `Settings -> Secrets and Variables -> Actions`
    - click `New Repository Secret`
    - enter `SONAR_TOKEN` and paste in the secret. click `Add Secret`. Notice `SONAR_TOKEN` is referenced in `ci.yml` 
  > NOTE: There are sonar properties in the workflow yml file and `sonar-project.properties`. Used trial and error to figure out which ones belong where - could do with tidying up sometime 

  > NOTE: SonarCloud would not pickup coverage reports so workaround was to add a `.coveragerc` file in project root
 
## Docker 
- install docker desktop so the docker CLI is installed
- check it works by typing `docker` from terminal/cmd
- to connect the decktop to dockerhub, login to dockerhub `https://hub.docker.com/` and select `user -> My Account -> Security`
- click `New Access Token`, name it and copy the secret
- back to desktop type `docker login -u <dockerhub username>` and paste in secret for password.
- Create a docker image and tag it
```
docker build -t calculator-app . 
docker tag calculator-app kenlongdocker/calculator-app:latest
```
- Push the image to dockerhub image repository
```
docker push kenlongdocker/calculator-app:latest
```
- pull the latest image from the repository
```
docker pull kenlongdocker/calculator-app:latest
```
- run the image (a running instance of a docker image is a docker container)
```
- docker run -d -p 8000:8000 kenlongdocker/calculator-app:latest 
```
- to view running docker containers
```commandline
docker ps
```
- to kill a docker container
```commandline
docker kill <container id>
```
